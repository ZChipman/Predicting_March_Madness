# Predicting_March_Madness

## Background: The goal of this project was to use machine learning techniques to predict the 2022 NCAA Mens Basketball Tournament. This started as a final project for my Master Program's Big Data Analytics class under Professor Jon Fox (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonmfox/). The original project/code was created by myself and four teammates: Farahin Choudhury (https://www.linkedin.com/in/farahin-choudhury/), Matthew Laken (https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-laken-94643b151/), Annie Titus (https://www.linkedin.com/in/annietitus/), and Jiebin (Alex) Zhu (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiebinzhu/). Any future improvements to the code will be a solo effort.
