# Predicting_March_Madness

## Background: 

The goal of this project was to use machine learning techniques to predict the 2022 NCAA Mens Basketball Tournament. This started as a final project for my Master Program's Big Data Analytics class under Professor Jon Fox. The original project/code was created by myself and four teammates: Farahin Choudhury, Matthew Laken, Annie Titus, and Jiebin (Alex) Zhu. Any future improvements to the code will be a solo effort.
