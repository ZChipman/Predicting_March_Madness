# Predicting_March_Madness

## Background: 

The goal of this project was to use machine learning techniques to predict the 2022 NCAA Mens Basketball Tournament. This started as a final project for my Master Program's Big Data Analytics class under Professor Jon Fox. The original project/code was created by myself and four teammates: Farahin Choudhury, Matthew Laken, Annie Titus, and Jiebin (Alex) Zhu. Any future improvements to the code will be a solo effort. 

## Files:

2022 March Madness Prediction.docx: The written report for the project.

2022 March Madness Prediction.pptx: The presentation for the project.

2022 March Madness Prediction.ipynb: The code used to create the models for the project. Markdown notes offer some details on how the code works.

Note: The original data for this project will not be included as the data is owned by Google and is part of a Kaggle competiiton. A link to the original Kaggle page is included in the written report. 

## Technical Requirements:

Any text editor that supports python can be used to run the code. Use of a GPU is highly recommended given the size of the dataset (especially on older or less powerful hardware).

## Development:
